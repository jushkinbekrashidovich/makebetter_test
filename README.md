# makebetter_test

A test application of makebetter company

## Getting Started
1. About the application
  This is test task app which was given to me by makebetter company. Application must have login/register, counting steps, log out, and achievwments. Task must be completed about 4 to 8 hour. 
I have spent for this application about 7~8 hour. 

## Technologies that I used
1. Firebase (google_sign_in, firestore for DB,)
2. health package for counting steps

I spent most of my time working with integration google fit. OAuth 2.0 Client IDs generated and it is in test mode which means that only added users into a test mode can access the google fit datas. 

 
## How to run this app
 
If you want to run this applicaton as a developer you need to call me becaue I need to add your account into my firebase console and also SHA-1, SHA-256 keys. And Also I need to add your account to google api console for accessing fitness api. In there you can add your gmail account and test it.
