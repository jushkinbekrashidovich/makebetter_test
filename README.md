# makebetter_test

A test application of makebetter company

## Getting Started
1. About the application
  This is a test task app that was given to me by makebetter company. The application must have login/register, counting steps, log out, and achievements. The task must be completed in about 4 to 8 hours. 
I have spent for this application about 7~8 hours with breaks. 

## Technologies that I used
1. Firebase (google_sign_in, firestore for DB,)
2. health package for counting steps

I spent most of my time working with the integration of google fit, generating OAuth 2.0 Client IDs and integrate with app. It is in test mode which means that only added users into a test mode can access the google fit data. 

 
## How to run this app
 
If you want to run this application as a developer you need to call me because I need to add your account to my firebase console and also the SHA-1, and SHA-256 keys. And Also I need to add your account to the google cloud console for accessing fitness API. In there you can add your Gmail account and test it.
